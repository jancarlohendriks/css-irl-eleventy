It might be unusual for a web developer, but up until recently Iâ€™d never had an ad blocker installed. I use Firefox as my main browser, which claims to protect privacy by blocking trackers. And to be honest, I donâ€™t read a lot of articles on desktop, preferring to read the news on mobile while Iâ€™m on the go. While you might get one or two pop-ups on mobile, the area available for them is clearly a lot smaller, and I generally find the browsing experience for many of the sites I regularly visit is OK.

Most of the sites I do visit on desktop are for my day-to-day job, or research for this blog, and are built with developers as the target audience. I havenâ€™t noticed any/many annoying popups or slow-loading pages on these sites, probably because I know which sites can be trusted to provide quality content, and the people who build them care about user experience.

So, all in all, I hadnâ€™t massively felt the need for an ad blocker, although I figured it would probably make my browsing experience marginally more pleasant. Another reason why I didnâ€™t install one was because I believe it helps me as a developer to browse the web in a way thatâ€™s similar to my end users. Iâ€™m reminded of [a tweet](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1490693841166671882?s=20&t=1bKz5-YQkUdiOIMFQlbmnQ) from [Sara Soueidan](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan) recently:

Yes, many users **do** install ad blockers, but many more do not. I doubt either my parents or grandparents would even know what an ad blocker is. If Iâ€™m testing a site, I donâ€™t want to be left with the impression that itâ€™s faster than it actually is for the majority of users, simply because Iâ€™m blocking ads. I know many ad blockers allow whitelisting, but having to remember to do that all the time isnâ€™t ideal. Which brings me to another point: Many of the sites I value rely on revenue from unobtrusive ads. I even have small ads on my own site. I want to support the creators that I care about to earn a living through advertising, but remembering to whitelist all of these is a faff.

I changed my mind recently, however, when browsing the web without an ad blocker became unbearable. Iâ€™ve been researching for various talks and articles, which has meant visiting a lot of sites I donâ€™t usually rely on. Honestly, the number of popup windows and autoplaying videos I had to close, the number of pages I killed entirely because they were so slow to load that I thought my browser had crashed, came as a shock even to me as a web professional. And thatâ€™s on a decent MacBook Pro, with a fibre broadband connection.

Weâ€™re used to the web providing us with all kinds of conveniences. But itâ€™s really a miracle that many people with spotty wi-fi, limited data, or older devices can get anything done online at all. Iâ€™d estimate that the amount of resources I downloaded from ads far outweighed the actual webpage content on the sites I visited. In a world where we all need to seriously conserve resources and minimise the carbon footprint of our sites, ads and trackers should be the first things to go.

Iâ€™m aware that the conversation around monetisation on the web is far from simple. But this state of affairs is surely serving no one.
